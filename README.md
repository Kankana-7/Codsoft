TASK-1: Titanic Survival Prediction
Using the Titanic dataset I had to build a model that predicts whether a passenger on the Titanic survived or not. 
The dataset typically used for this project contains informationabout individual passengers, such as their age, gender, ticketclass, fare, cabin, and whether 
or not they survived. Here, I used Logistic Regression to fit the model.

TASK-2: Movie Rating Prediction
Here the task was to build a model that predicts the rating of a movie based onfeatures like genre, director, and actors. You can use regression
techniques to tackle this problem.
The goal was to analyze historical movie data and develop a modelthat accurately estimates the rating given to a movie by users or critics.
Here, I used various supervised machine learning models and compared their performances with each other. 

TASK-3: Iris Flower Classification
The Iris flower dataset consists of three species: setosa, versicolor,and virginica. These species can be distinguished based on their measurements. Now, 
I have got the measurements of Iris flowers categorized by their respective species. My objective was to train a machine learning model that can learn from
these measurements and accurately classify the Iris flowers intotheir respective species. Here, I used Linear Discriminant Analysis to classify the species. 
Used the Iris dataset to develop a model that could classify irisflowers into different species based on their sepal and petal measurements. 

TASK-4: Sales Prediction Using Python
Sales prediction involves forecasting the amount of a product that customers will purchase, taking into account various factors such as
advertising expenditure, target audience segmentation, and advertising platform selection. Here, I used Simple Linear Regression for 
forecasting the sales.

TASK-5: Credit Card Fraud Detection
Here, the task was to build a machine learning model to identify fraudulent credit cardtransactions. Here, I used Logistic Regression and 
Random Forest Models. Then evaluated the models based on the performance using metrics like precision, recall,
and F1-score
